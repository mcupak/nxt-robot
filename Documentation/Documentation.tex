\section{Introduction}
We have decided to create an interpret - robot capable of reading graphical instructions and later executing them. As a hardware, we have picked four-wheel car with two light sensor, one that reads movement line and ensures that robot stays on its path and second one for instructions. Using our instruction set, one can make the car move in different directions or make sounds. Each instruction corresponds to a four bit number (we call such number byte), that is encoded using four colored stripes, each representing on or off bit.
