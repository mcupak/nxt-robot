\subsection{Construction}
What sort of the hardware we use? How did you design it? What probles you have encountered while building it?

For self-calibration of the position is best to use three wheel vehicle with signe free wheel in the front and two wheels with independent motors in the back (sort of the thing that is built right now). \\
However, I think that 4-wheel vehicle with single motor for movement and second one for steering will be better for execution of instructions and overall more awesome, so I suggest building that one - there is a howto for one pretty, I would build on that: \verb+http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/race_car/steps.html+ .
