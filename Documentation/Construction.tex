\section{Construction}
We used a rear-wheel-driven car with steering at the front. The back of the car is powered by two motors working simultaneously. The front wheel steering is assured by one motor. 
There are two light sensors placed on the robotic car. At first we put them on the back (one in the middle, the other one on the right side). Soon we found out, that this constellation of 
sensors didn't allow for the properties we wanted. Mainly, one sensor was reading slightly darker values than the other one and also the placement didn't work very well because of the steering 
(the sensor detected that the car was off-track later than we would want). So on the second attempt we placed the sensors at the front at both sides. This placement worked much better for us.
%What sort of the hardware we use? How did you design it? What probles you have encountered while building it?
