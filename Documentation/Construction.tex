\section{Construction}
We used a rear-wheel-driven car with steering in the front. As an engine, we use two simultaneously working motors, while steering is assured by a single motor with gear box. 

There are two build-on light sensors. At first we put them on the back (one in the middle, the other one on the right side), but soon we have found out that this constellation of sensors does not allow behaviour that we wanted it to express - one sensor read slightly darker values than the other one and also this placement problematically coped with our method of steering - track sensor detected that the car was off-track later than we would want.

Currently we have light sensors on the sides of the car, having the same distance and direction from the core of the car, giving us requested precision of the reading.
